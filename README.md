# Diabetes-Prediction

Implementation of SVM Algorithm to solve Classification Problem. Steps:-
1. Importing Libraries
2. Reading Dataset
3. Dataset Pre-Processing
4. Test-Train Split
5. Fit data into SVM model with kernel that has highest accuracy and lowest error rate
6. Made a predictive system to predict whether a person has diabetes from the set of values given as an input.

I have collected the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?select=diabetes.csv) and have used SVM Machine Learning algorithm to predict whether any person is having diabetes.
